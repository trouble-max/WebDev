                St. Peter's Basilica<br>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Basilica_di_San_Pietro_in_Vaticano_September_2015-1a.jpg/1200px-Basilica_di_San_Pietro_in_Vaticano_September_2015-1a.jpg" alt="St. Peter's Basilica" width="305">
                <p class="ave-maria">The centerpiece of the Vatican and one of the best places to visit, the magnificent St. Peter's Basilica was built between the 16th and 18th centuries, replacing earlier structures that began in 326 on what is thought to be where St. Peter was buried. Ironically, it was the selling of indulgences to finance this building in the 16th century that provoked Martin Luther to begin the Protestant Reformation.

                Sistine Chapel<br>

                <p class="ave-maria">Built by Pope Sixtus IV in 1473-84, the Sistine Chapel is a rectangular hall, which is the Pope's domestic chapel, also used for services and special occasions. After the death of a Pope, the conclave to elect his successor is held here. The frescoes by Michelangelo and others covering the walls and ceiling, acknowledged as the pinnacle of Renaissance painting, were extensively restored from 1980 to 1994, removing layers of candle-soot, dust, varnish, grease, and overpainting to reveal their original luminous colors.

                The Raphael Rooms
                <p class="ave-maria">These rooms, commissioned for the <strong>Palace of the Vatican's</strong> papal apartments by the art-loving Pope Julius II and later by Pope Leo X, are covered with a magnificent series of frescoes by Raphael. In re-discovering the traditions of historical painting, Raphael began an art tradition that was to be followed for centuries. In each of the scenes, he uses a classical symmetry in the composition, positioning the characters in perspective around a central focal point.
